# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches
* List based UI

* Button-Modal based UI

* Card-Carousel based UI

### 2. Version Differences
The first version features a UI based on listing all of the things in the UI, like amount selection and payment method.

The second version features a UI based on buttons with details, which when pressed will display a modal card displaying the details.

### 3. Selected Sketch
I am selecting the second sketch as my design because I want to experiment with this UI, an also because it seems to be the simplest in terms of usability and interface

### 4. Design Rationale
From my contextual inquiry, I've learned that simplicity can be good in this UI, because of the simplicity of the task and that the users will want a faster experience with this kind of task.

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
The assumptions for the hardware is:
* Targeted for agnostic mobile platform
* Around 5-inch screen size (16:9)
* No physical button to help with navigation
* The screen and interface is colored.

### 2. Users
The assumptions for the users of this app are:
* The users level of experience are ranged from novice to experienced.
* Will be targeted for users from all age
* Familiar with using mobile devices, (at the very least know how to operate and do simple tasks)
* Will be used in an environment where data connection is limited.
* Fast user experience in doing the task is very important

## Part C: Prototypes
